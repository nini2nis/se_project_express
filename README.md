# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This project marks the beginning of the Back-end programming curriculum of Sprint 12 and goes on to cover Sprint 13.
MongoDB thru mongoose and Express were implemented to set up the back-end infrastracture to the previously designed What To Wear app.
With Sprint 13 the authorization module was added to implement jsonwebtoken use. Authorization was added to most routes where only a specific user can view, create, update or deleteitems as well as view and update profiles.

## Running the Project

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing
